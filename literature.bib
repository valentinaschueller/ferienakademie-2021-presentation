	abstract = {Variations in the width and strength of the Hadley cells are associated with many radiative, thermodynamic, and dynamical forcings. The physical mechanisms driving these responses remain unclear, in part because of the interactive nature of eddy-mean flow adjustment. Here, a modeling framework is developed which separates the mean flow and time-mean eddy flow in a gray radiation general circulation model with simple representations of ocean heat transport and ozone. In the absence of eddies, with moist convection and weak numerical damping, the Hadley cell is confined to the upper troposphere and has a vanishingly small poleward momentum flux. Eddies allow the cell to extend down to the surface, double its heat transport, and flux momentum poleward, the latter two being basic consequences of a deepening of the circulation. Because of convection and damping—which mimics, in part, the effect of eddy stresses—previous work may have underestimated the impact of eddies on earth's circulation. Quasigeostrophic eddy fluxes are sufficient to produce Hadley and Ferrel cells, but with a substantially greater Hadley cell strength than when all eddy impacts are considered, including eddy fluxes of moisture, mass, and momentum and eddy impacts on surface fluxes and clouds.},

A simple approximate theory [similar to that introduced by Schneider (1977)] is developed for the case in which the fluid is sufficiently inviscid that the poleward flow in the Hadley cell is nearly angular momentum conserving. The theory predicts the width of the Hadley cell, the total poleward heat flux, the latitude of the upper level jet in the zonal wind, and the distribution of surface easterlies and westerlies. Fundamental differences between such nearly inviscid circulations and the more commonly studied viscous axisymmetric flows are emphasized. The theory is checked against numerical solutions to the model equations.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Alternative policies to address global climate change are being debated in many nations and within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. To help provide objective and comprehensive analyses in support of this process, we have developed a model of the global climate system consisting of coupled sub-models of economic growth and associated emissions, natural ﬂuxes, atmospheric chemistry, climate, and natural terrestrial ecosystems. The framework of this Integrated Global System Model is described and the results of sample runs and a sensitivity analysis are presented. This multi-component model addresses most of the major anthropogenic and natural processes involved in climate change and also is computationally efﬁcient. As such, it can be used effectively to study parametric and structural uncertainty and to analyze the costs and impacts of many policy alternatives.},
